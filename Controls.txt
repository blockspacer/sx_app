// Controls

A few controls are available in order to bring out the interesting behaviours. The following list enumerates 
the controls and their effect on the application.

-	1/2/3 : Choose the buffering mode between
	- No buffering: Synchronous rendering, by passing the command buffer. Server thread is sleeping in this mode.
	- Double buffer: Asynchronous rendering using a double buffer between the client and the server threads.
	- Triple buffer: Asynchronous rendering using a triple buffer between the client and the server threads.
 
-	+/- : Increase/decrease the number of lights. This can be used in order to increase scene complexity. Even 
if the client and the server thread are affected by this tuning, it mostly influences Gpu frame rate.

-	D : Hide/Display light dummies. The light dummies rendering is done by the application, using the driver 
API. Thus enabling this option increase command buffer usage and the number of locked and built commands. As 
the light dummy model (a sphere) is quite small, it doesn’t influence a lot the Gpu frame rate, but rather 
the client and server threads.

-	A/Z : Introduce a delay in the main loop (client thread). This can be used to slow done the loop in order 
to simulate game update time. Notice that server thread fps will never be higher than the client one.

-	R : Reset to default controls.
