// Statistics

Some statistics are collected and displayed during application update and rendering:

-	Client thread Fps: measures the frame rate of the client update loop. This loop includes every rendering 
call to the driver.

-	Server thread Fps: measures the frame rate of the server thread loop. This loop executes all the platform 
graphic API calls. This counter isn’t valid when the synchronous command buffer is used, as the server thread 
is unused in this case.

-	Gpu theoretical Fps: This counter measures the time the Gpu spent executing rendering, ie: the execution 
of all the graphic API commands executed by the Gpu. It uses a query mechanism that isn’t available on all 
hardware, and thus can be invalid.

-	Command buffer size: The memory footprint of the command buffer of the displayed frame.

-	Built commands count: Represent the number of commands (including states), that were modified and executed 
during the frame. Before being dispatched on the server side, modified commands are built once. In 
this demo, sxCTransformState, sxCMaterialState and sxCRenderTargetState are modified during the update (on 
the client side).

-	Dispatched commands count: The number of commands (including states) that are dispatched on the server 
side during frame execution.

-	D3d9 calls count: The number of calls to the D3d9 graphic API. The comparison between this count and the 
dispatched commands count outlines the one-to-many concept.
